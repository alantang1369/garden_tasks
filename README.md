# garden_tasks
Finally I finished the last project for Flatiron. This project also continues the “Hibiscus” theme that I have been building all apps for. This time I did not show you guys about hibiscus anymore but instead I built an app that would help me or whoever wants some help in gardening. The app is called “Garden Tasks” which will help us to keep track of garden tasks such as watering, feeding and protecting plants from pests and diseases. I personally find this app is more useful than the other app I built throughout the program. For someone who has more than a hundred plants to take care of like me, sometimes it is such a pain in the butt to try to remember which day to do what. Admitted that we can always record the data in excel but why not try to utilize my software developing skills to solve the problem. With Garden Tasks, I will not only be able to record the tasks but also let it remind me when an action needs to be done. This app is built with React, Redux in the frontend and Rails API running in the backend. I keep the look of this app very simple because I don’t know much about css or any libraries to help with the view like bootstrap or semantic css ui. I will learn semantic-css-ui later while I am applying for a job. It looks like an interesting library to know for a more efficient css. After learning React and Javascript, I feel more capable of working as a software engineer now. Despite the fact that there are many more things to learn before I can land a job in Tech, it is a remarkable milestone that I will never forget in my coding journey.
